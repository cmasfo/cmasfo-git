The Main Repo

## Introduction

Basically this repo contains all other repos as submodules.

This repo contains lots of code, docs, or projects.

To see more information about cmasfo itself, please see docs directory.

The docs directory is also docs submodule.

I'm aware of that 'docs' folder does some special role in github,
but I'm not using it in that way.

And that role can be replaced by '.github' directory.
That's the way that I prefer.

## How to Clone This Repo

Prerequisites: git  
Download link: https://git-scm.com

```
git clone https://github.com/cmasfo/cmasfo-git
cd cmasfo-git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

I do not prefer using submodules in hierarchical structure.

So there is no need to init or update recursively, at least for now.
