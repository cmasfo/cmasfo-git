# C & C++

## Introduction

C & C++ serve a crucial role in the IT industry.

It is not just one of various programming languages.

The code, especially which is written in C,
supports funamental base of IT ecosystem, and that is huge.

And C++ just follow after that.

That is enough reason to learn C or C++.

## Downside

Honestly, I think that it's better to use Rust, which is my main preferring language.

And also lots of companies are considering using Rust instead of C or C++.

C and C++ did, and are doing great job, but they have lots of downsides.

* Complexity

Their codes are too easy to be complex.
Unless the programmer has founded a very strict rule,
the code can be very easy to be verbose and error-prone.

And that is especially worse in C++. C++ supports C code.
But some programmers don't like C++, while they prefer using C.
That thing can also happen in reverse.
Thus those languages are close, but yet quite different as the same time.

* Inconsistency

C and C++ don't have a common compiler like Rust does.

There are lots of tools that are related to C or C++,
such as MS Build, CMake, make, gcc, and so on.

What I prefer is CMake, rather than MS Build,
since CMake supports cross-platform build.

But handling CMake is not easy. That is problem though.

* Unsafety

The crucial problem is unsafety.

Let's premise that we have overcome the complexity and inconsistency.
We've now compiled the project successfully.

However, is that guaranteed to work properly and safely?

Well, if it's written in C or C++, unfortunately, nope.

The program that is written in C or C++ needs to be tested and fixed
for very long duration,
since nobody can be sure about the safety and crucial bug.
That also happen at the production level.

The wrong C & C++ code already have caused lots of troubles in IT industry historically.
Well, then, were they novices? Absolutely not!
They had enough expertise, and were aware of various cases about security vulnerabilities.
But humans make mistake.
And some mistakes don't be revealed at early stages and cause trouble very later.

If the programmer lacks the expertise,
the program will be much easier to have problems.
Thus, C & C++ can be considered as unsafe programming languages.

## Conclusion

You might not choose to use C or C++.

Even if you do, it would be better to learn them.

Because lots of fundamental things are written in them, especially in C.

For example, Linux and Windows are written in C.

Even if someone like Rust, they still need to work on OS which is written in C.

Similary, lots of hardware firmware is also written in C.

Because of that, to run Rust code on the bare metal,
it needs to use C API or FFI in most cases.

It highlights the significant role that C and C++ play in the IT industry.
